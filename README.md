# Sales Data Analysis & Dashboard (AdventureWorks Dataset)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow** starting with **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python (pandas)** and building an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to analyze sales performance across products, channels, customers, and regions.


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- Git & GitHub

## 📊 Analysis Performed
1. **EDA in Python**
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas
   - Created new features such as monthly sales trends, revenue per order, and profit margins
   - Identified top-performing products, high-margin items, and customer purchase behaviors

2. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - **Page 1 (Overview & Trends):** Revenue, profit, orders, and profit margin trends by month  
   - **Page 2 (Product & Channel):** Top 10 products, high-margin products, revenue & profit by channel  
   - **Page 3 (Customer & Geography):** Top  & Bottom customers, top states, and regional sales distribution  


## 📈 Key Insights
- Total Revenue: **$1.24B** with a **Profit Margin of 37%**  
- **Wholesale channel** contributed the highest share (54% of total revenue)  
- **California** generated the highest revenue among all states  
- Top 10 products contributed significantly to overall revenue, while certain niche products delivered **higher profit margins**  
- A small segment of customers contributed disproportionately to total revenue 
- Seasonal trends observed: sales peaked in **January–February** and then stabilized over the year
